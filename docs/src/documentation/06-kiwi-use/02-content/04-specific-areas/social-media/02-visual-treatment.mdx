**_As the old Czech proverb goes: "Don't just say it, show it!"_**

The right imagery makes our content much more powerful and engaging.
It also helps us to differentiate from our competitors.

Our photography should always have a sense of optimism.
The subjects and environments should feel authentic.
We shouldn't be afraid of showing **real faces and emotions.**
People should be **unposed** and their **composition** within the environment **natural**.
Lighting, color and tone should be **unfiltered and realistic \#NoFilter! **

Each image should establish an emotional connection with our audience, showing them the world Kiwi.com can offer.

## Our destinations...

**ARE** real, authentic and full of wanderlust.
Images don't just show the place but the _details_ of the people and the story.

**ARE NOT** unrealistic, over edited, broad stock landscapes that lack emotion.
