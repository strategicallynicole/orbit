## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="RatingStars" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="164%3A0"
  alt="Rating: indicates the rating rounded to a whole number; empty: optionally shows the potential rating not obtained."
/>

## Behavior

### Make clear what is being rated

Rating stars automatically come with an aria label to describe the rating in words
for [those who might not see the visual cues](/foundation/accessibility/).
Use the context to make sure that it's clear what the rating covers
even if a user doesn't see the stars.

## Look & feel

### Types

Ratings stars can be small, medium, or large.
