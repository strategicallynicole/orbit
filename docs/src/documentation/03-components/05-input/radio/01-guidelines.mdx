</Guidelines>


### Show multiple options, but not too many

Radios force users to choose only one option.
Make sure they're always presented with two or more options.
If you have many options to choose from,
onsider using a [select](/components/input/select/)
to decrease the initial cognitive load on users.

## Content

### Write positive labels

In addition to [writing positively in general](/content/voice-tone/passionate/#use-positive-language),
you should especially focus on positive labels for checkboxes.
Focus on what will happen when the checkbox is selected.
Do not use the selected state for turning off features.
