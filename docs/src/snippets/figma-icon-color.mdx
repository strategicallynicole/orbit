<p>When you add a new icon to {props.component.match(/^[aeiou]/) ? "an" : "a"} {props.component} in Figma,
you need to adjust the color.
When you change the icon,
the icon color gets changed to the default icon color.
All Orbit icons have their defaults set to <InlineToken value="paletteInkNormal" alternateName />.</p>


After adding your icon,
click the current color in the right sidebar (under **Selection Colors**)
and select the color you want.

<h3>Which color to choose for which {props.component}?</h3>
